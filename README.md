The informational website says it all about what there is to Buddiey, so feel free to go there and see it for yourself! If you want a simple explanation directly on the README.md, then keep reading.

> The Buddiey web app (app.buddiey.live) is based on React.js, rather than HTML5, which opens new doors for immersion and a grand experience with Buddiey.



# Wait, what is Buddiey?

> Buddiey was originally a science fair project created by a team known as the Buddiey Builders. It evolved to be a full-stack web application for isolated and lonely senior citizens to feel more confortable and more happy in general. The robot you talk to, Buddiey, is pre-loaded with lots of knowledge, so he knows exactly what to say, when following a very basic guideline in commands. Try it out now!
